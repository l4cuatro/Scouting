Briefly describe the personal benefits gained from this project:

I gained a sense of pride knowing that every time someone passes through the gate adjacent to my project site or plays next to it in the parking lot, they see the fruits of my labor. I was able to give back to the school and the church that has played a significant role in my development as a person. 

In your own words, describe what it means to attain the rank of Eagle:

The rank is a recognition of the hard work I have put into Boy Scouts over the last seven years. It is proof to myself and others that I have developed the skills and character traits expected of an Eagle Scout and that I am qualified to be counted among the ranks of a group of great men.
